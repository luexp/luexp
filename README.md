## 👨‍⚕️ About Me:

Hi there! I am a medical doctor and researcher who is passionate about neuroscience, technology, and biology. My clinical focus is on longevity and mental health, and I enjoy learning about new tools and building scrappy prototypes.

I am currently part of the Product team at Function Health.

I consulted several startups and also co-founded Katharsis, a mental health platform offering psychedelic-assisted therapy in a safe and medically assisted context. 

I was a clinical research fellow at Imperial College Psychedelic Science Unit, a psychiatry resident at Geneva University Hospital, and an anesthesiology resident at Policlinico di Milano. 

🌍 Based in Rome, Italy
