## 👨‍⚕️ About Me:

Unusual medical doctor with a product-engineering bend. I am passionate about neuroscience, artificial intelligence and biology. 

My clinical interests are in longevity and mental health — currently working as a Product Manager at Function Health where I am a bridge between the clinical and product/eng/design teams. 

I consulted several early-stage startups in the digital health space and co-founded my own, a mental health platform offering psychedelic-assisted therapy in a safe and medically assisted setting. 

I was a clinical research fellow at Imperial College Psychedelic Science Unit, a psychiatry resident at Geneva University Hospital, and an anesthesiology resident at Policlinico di Milano. 

Outside work, I enjoy trail running, trekking, archery, and quality time with friends.

🌍 Based in Italy
